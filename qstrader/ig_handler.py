        The PortfolioHandler is designed to interact with the
        backtesting or live trading overall event-driven
        architecture. It exposes two methods, on_signal and
        on_fill, which handle how SignalEvent and FillEvent
        objects are dealt with.

        Each PortfolioHandler contains a Portfolio object,
        which stores the actual Position objects.

        The PortfolioHandler takes a handle to a PositionSizer
        object which determines a mechanism, based on the current
        Portfolio, as to how to size a new Order.

        The PortfolioHandler also takes a handle to the
        RiskManager, which is used to modify any generated
        Orders to remain in line with risk parameters.
